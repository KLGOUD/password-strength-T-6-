# 🔐 Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, test multiple passwords of varying complexity using an online strength checker tool, analyze the results, and document best practices for creating secure passwords.

## 🛠️ Tool Used

- 🌐 [PasswordMeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com): A free online password strength checker used to analyze password complexity and score their strength.

## 🧪 Passwords Tested and Results

I created a set of passwords with increasing complexity and tested each one using **PasswordMeter.com**. Below are the results:

| Password        | Strength Score | Tool Feedback Summary |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| `kali123`       | ~30%           | Weak – too short, only lowercase and numbers, predictable |
| `kali@123`      | ~55%           | Medium – added symbol improves strength but still common |
| `k@li12345!`    | ~85%           | Strong – longer, includes symbol, lowercase, and numbers |
| `Kali321`       | ~40%           | Slightly better – mixed case and digits, but short and lacks symbols |

🖼️ **Screenshots** of each result were taken directly from the PasswordMeter website to document the score and feedback.

These images show the visual feedback from PasswordMeter for each password tested.

## 📘 Tips Learned from Evaluation

1. **Longer is Stronger**: Passwords with 12+ characters are much harder to crack.
2. **Mix Character Types**: Use uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols.
3. **Avoid Common Words**: Passwords like `kali123` are easily guessable and weak.
4. **Don't Use Predictable Patterns**: Adding numbers at the end (like `123`, `321`) is predictable.
5. **Passphrases Work Well**: Using phrases with substitutions (e.g., `H@ckM3Pl3@se!`) provides better strength and memorability.

## 🛡️ Summary of Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries all possible combinations of characters until it cracks the password. |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses a list of common passwords and words (like "password123"). |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Tries leaked passwords from previous breaches on multiple platforms. |
| **Phishing** | Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake websites or emails. |

## ✅ Outcome

- Learned how password length, character variety, and randomness affect strength.
- Practiced using an online tool to measure and compare password security.
- Gained insights into how attackers crack weak passwords.
- Understood and documented strong password creation tips to follow in real-world scenarios.
